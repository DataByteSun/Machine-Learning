## Introduction

This repository is designed for learners and practitioners of machine learning. Each Jupyter notebook provides a practical example of a specific algorithm, complete with a story explaining the context and purpose of the work.

## Getting Started

To get started with the examples in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DataByteSun/Machine-Learning.git

## Examples
Here we will explore 2 types of Machine Learning algorithm examples:
1. Supervised Learning
   - A. Regression
      - [Linear Regression](Notebooks/Linear_regression.ipynb)
      - Ridge Regression
      - Lasso Regression
      - Support Vector Regression (SVR)
      - Decision Trees Regression
      - Random Forest Regression
      - Gradient Boosting Regression
      - Neural Networks Regression
   - B. Classification
      - Logistic Regression
      - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
      - k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
      - Naive Bayes
      - Decision Trees
      - Random Forest
      - Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)
      - Neural Networks (e.g., Multilayer Perceptron)

2. Unsupervised Learning
   - Clustering
      - K-Means Clustering
      - Hierarchical Clustering
